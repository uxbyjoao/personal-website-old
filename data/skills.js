Using Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and even Lightroom (I'm a hobbyist photographer as well) is second nature to me. In fact, I started my UX career designing websites in Photoshop for an advertising agency back in 2012.",

      "Around 2017, I took the leap and started to teach myself actual front-end development in my spare time. Since then, I have acquired what I would say is enough development knowledge to be dangerous as a designer. In my current job, I am ocasionally given the oportunity to code, and have coded static sites and application prototypes. I know my way around React, Vue.js, Firebase, and will even risk dabbling with the back-end using Node when I'm feeling daring. This website, for example, was developed using Next.js and TailwindCSS.",
