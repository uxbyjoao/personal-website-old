      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I was born in Brazil, have a dual citizenship from Portugal, and
        currently reside in Germany. My native language is Portuguese and I have
        fluent command of English. I am a level A2.2 German speaker, but very
        eager to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a B. A. in Communication Science from the University of Fortaleza
        (UNIFOR) and am currently finishing a M. Sc. in Usability Engineering at
        the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm working remotely for a company in Canada called NE2
        Group, where I'm responsible for creating and maintaining their design
        system, as well as designing and redesigning their digital products. I
        also do a little bit of graphic design work for them as well, but it's
        very minor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I like to sing, record and play music (fun fact: I was
        also a professional musician from 2010 to 2017), play games on my
        computer, and code. I also enjoy photography and traveling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am fascinated by technology and how transformative it has been in our
        society. I am just old enough to remember a world without the internet,
        and I am astounded by the impact that personal computing has, and
        continues to have, on our world.
