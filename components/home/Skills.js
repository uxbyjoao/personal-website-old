        <h4>Figma</h4>
        <p>
          Figma is my main tool and I have been using it since 2018. It has
          replaced Sketch as my go-to software for design. I have clocked in
          over 2800 hours in Figma in the last two years alone, creating
          everything from high-fidelity prototypes to design systems.

        <h4>Adobe Creative Suite</h4>
        <p>
          My background is in graphic design - hence, I am highly proficient
          with the Adobe application suite. Using Photoshop, Illustrator,
          InDesign, and even Lightroom (I'm a hobbyist photographer as well) is
          second nature to me. In fact, I started my UX career designing
          websites in Photoshop for an advertising agency back in 2012.

        <h4>Framer</h4>
        <p>
          Framer is a tool that I've been learning in order to create higher
          fidelity prototypes and microinteractions. What has drawn me to it is
          the fact that one can use React and JavaScript to create components
          and control the prototypes with more precision.

        <h4>Front-End Development (HTML/CSS, ES6 JavaScript)</h4>
        <p>
          Around 2017, I took the leap and started to teach myself actual
          front-end development in my spare time. Since then, I have acquired
          what I would say is enough development knowledge to be dangerous as a
          designer. In my current job, I am ocasionally given the oportunity to
          code, and have coded static sites and application prototypes. I know
          my way around React, Vue.js, Firebase, and will even risk dabbling
          with the back-end using Node when I'm feeling daring. This website,
          for example, was developed using Next.js.

        <h4>Arduino</h4>
        <p>
          One of the things I'm most interested in is the Internet of Things,
          and as such, I have taught myself how to use the Arduino platform to
          develop simple projects, at a very basic level.
